# Sherlock AI - Deepfake Detection System

**Sherlock AI** is a machine learning application designed to detect synthetic media, known as deepfakes, in video and image content. As deepfakes become more sophisticated, they pose risks to information integrity and security. Sherlock AI aims to provide a reliable, user-friendly solution to help identify and mitigate these risks.

**Live Demo**: [Sherlock AI](https://divagarnavean6.github.io/sherlockk/)
